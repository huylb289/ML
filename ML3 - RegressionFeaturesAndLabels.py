##    Return the ceiling of x as an Integral.
##    This is the smallest integer >= x.

##This is how I understood sentdex logic,
##he is taking 0.01 or 1% of the length of all
##the rows within the dataframe. Each row in
##the dataFrame is representative of a day in
##the life of the stock. So if the stock has been trading for 365 days,
##there will be 365 rows in the dataFrame. 1% of 365 is 3.65 days
##which is then rounded up by the math.ceil function to 4 days.
##The 4 days will be the forecast _out variable which is the variable
##that used to shift the Adj.Close price column in the dataFame up by 4.
##In other words, if you were standing at day 1 of the stock when
##it was first traded, the prediction or the 'label' from his algorithm
##would tell you that at day 4, your stock will be valued at the amount
##of the close as taken on day 4 from actual data.
##This isn't totally useful information since you can look at
##the Adj.Close column on day 4 to get back to the label info on day 1.
##This is really all done to build a training set so that the machine can
##learn from the trend.ï»¿
